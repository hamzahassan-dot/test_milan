AOCL-BLIS - Release Notes - version 4.0
--------------------------------------------

BLIS is a portable software framework for instantiating high-performance 
BLAS-like dense linear algebra libraries. The framework was designed to isolate 
essential kernels of computation that enable optimized 
implementations of most of its commonly used and computationally intensive 
operations.  AMD has extensively optimized the implementation of BLIS for AMD processors. 

Highlights of AOCL-BLIS 4.0
--------------------------------
- Below LPGEMM variants are added along with post-ops support
	o aocl_gemm_u8s8s32o32 AVX512-VNNI optimized.
	o aocl_gemm_u8s8s16o16 AVX2 optimized.
	o aocl_gemm_bf16bf16bf16 and aocl_gemm_bf16bf16f32 AVX512 optimized.
- SGEMM with packed/reorder buffer support (aocl_gemm_f32f32f32f32).
- zen4 support for BLIS.
- Dynamic dispatch supports zen4 config.
- CBLAS/BLAS interface decoupling for the level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 APIs.
- Multi-Threading support for BFloat16 gemm.
- DGEMM and SGEMM â€“ optimizations for zen4.
- Performance improvements for DGEMM, SGEMM and ZGEMM.
- Performance improvements for DGEMMT and DTRSM.
- Framework Design changes.
- Bug Fixes.

Please refer AOCL User Guide for supported Operating Systems and Compilers.

The package contains AOCL-BLIS Library binaries which includes optimizations for
the AMD EPYC and AMD Ryzen processor families, header files and examples.

Known Issues
